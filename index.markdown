    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
          The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically changed every aspect of daily life in cities across the globe, San Francisco included. As public health mandates reshaped patterns of movement, social interaction, and economic activity, these shifts also had significant implications for criminal behavior.

## Crimes and COVID

If there was any doubt about the effect of COVID-19, the relation between positive tests and crime numbers is outlined in the interactive figure below. Feel free to explore the levels of different crimes in relation to each other and, most notably, to the percentage of positive COVID-19 tests. 

<figure style="text-align: center; margin: 2em 0;">

</figure>


Here, the right y-axis shows a seven-day rolling average of the number of COVID-tests (blue curve) and the left shows a seven-day rolling average of crime count. As expected, most crimes show a decreasing rate during the peak years of the pandemic, with larceny/theft serving as a notable example; given the official stay-at-home order forcing people to remain in their houses, it is unsurprising that this particular offense experienced a significant decrease in occurences.

Suprisingly, it appears that crime incidents for burglary increase during the pandemic. This highlights the need investigate just how much each crime was affected.

## Most Affected Crimes

For a deeper examination of the extent to which each crime category was impacted, see the graph below. 

<figure style="text-align: center; margin: 2em 0;">

</figure>

The data reveal that there is a large difference in crime trends during the COVID lockdown period for some of the focus crimes. 
Many offenses— such as larceny/theft, assault, drug/narcotics, and prostitution—declined. With fewer people out on the streets and in public spaces, there were fewer opportunities for crimes like robbery and assault, as well as prostitution to occur. Also, the closure of local businesses and fewer tourists, might have led to fewer cases of larceny and shoplifting. 

Interestingly, burglaries surged by almost 70%. This pattern may be explained by several interrelated factors:

*   Reduced Security:
Lockdown orders meant that many residences and businesses were left unoccupied. With fewer people present, the natural surveillance and security measures were significantly reduced. This created ideal conditions for burglars to target properties with minimal risk.

*   Shift in Criminal Opportunity:
Routine activity theory suggests that crime occurs when potential offenders come into contact with suitable targets, without the threat of potential security measures. As public spaces saw fewer interactions -- leading to declines in crimes like larceny and assault -- burglary became a more attractive option for offenders, particularly those who target commercial premises or vacant homes.

*   Economic Pressure:
The financial uncertainty and increased economic stress during the pandemic may have driven some people toward property crimes as a means to supplement lost income. This economic desperation could partly explain the pronounced rise in burglaries, even as other crime categories experienced downturns.

*   Displacement Effects:
With heightened police presence and enforcement efforts in public areas to stop street crimes, offenders may have shifted their focus toward crimes that exploit less monitored environments, such as burglary. This displacement of criminal activity highlights how changes in routine activities can have uneven impacts across different crime types.

Overall, the nearly 70% increase in burglaries during the COVID period signals that while reduced mobility and increased public enforcement helped lower other types of crimes, they created vulnerabilities in areas with diminished guardianship. Studies such as those by Yim and Riddell (2022) have discussed similar trends during this period in san fransisco. For the last section, we will investigate the location trends for burglaries over time during this period. [[1]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9387408/)

## Map of Burglary Incidents Over Time

Previous analysis revealed that burglary incidents increased during the lockdown periods in San Francisco. The below map compares the locations of reported burglary incidents in San Francisco before and during the lockdowns. This analysis explores whether crime patterns shifted geographically within the city. One hypothesis suggested that burglary incidents would increase in industrial areas as the stay-at-home order left them unattended [citation]. However, the visualization of the data does not reveal this.

## Conclusion

The COVID-19 pandemic brought significant changes to crime patterns in San Francisco, revealing intriguing shifts that may reflect broader social and economic impacts. While the decline in crimes like assault, theft, and prostitution aligns with reduced public interaction during lockdowns, the surge in burglaries suggests that decreased guardianship, shifting criminal opportunities, and economic pressures could have contributed to this trend. These observations raise interesting questions about how sudden disruptions can reshape criminal behavior and what this might mean for future crisis responses. Further exploration could help clarify these patterns and inform strategies for addressing crime in times of widespread upheaval.
