    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
          The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically changed every aspect of daily life in cities across the globe, San Francisco included. As public health mandates reshaped patterns of movement, social interaction, and economic activity, these shifts also had significant implications for criminal behavior.

    <h3>The dataset</h3>
    <p>
      Our analysis is based on the Our data comes from

      -- a database of incidents from the San Fransisco Police Department (SFPD), detailling crimes from 2003 to 2024. The data has been cleaned and sorted, so it consists of the following columns:

These columns provide all the necessary data for our analysis.

## Crimes and COVID

If there was any doubt about the effect of COVID-19, the relation between positive tests and crime numbers is outlined in the interactive figure below. Feel free to explore the levels of different crimes in relation to each other and, most notably, to the percentage of positive COVID-19 tests.

</figure>


Here, the left y-axis shows the percentage of positive tests in a given week (green curve) and the right shows the weekly crime count (i.e. the sum of crimes in a given week). As expected, most crimes show a decreasing rate during the peak years of the pandemic, with prostitution serving as a notable example; given widespread public concern regarding physical contact during this period, it is unsurprising that this particular offense experienced a significant decrease in occurences.

While the graph serves as an interactive illustration of the occurences of different crimes during the pandemic, it would be beneficial to investigate just how much each crime was affected.

## Most Affected Crimes

For a deeper examination of the extent to which each crime category was impacted, see the graph below.

The data reveal that there is a large difference in crime trends during the COVID lockdown period for some of the focuscrimes. 
Many offenses—such as larceny/theft, assault, drug/narcotics, and prostitution—declined. With fewer people out on the streets and in public spaces, there were fewer opportunities for crimes like robbery and assault, as well as prostitution to occur. Also, the closure of local businesses and fewer tourists, might have led to fewer cases of larceny and shoplifting. 

Interestingly, burglaries surged by almost 70%. This pattern may be explained by several interrelated factors:

*   Reduced Guardianship:
Lockdown orders meant that many residences and businesses were left unoccupied. With fewer people present, the natural surveillance and guardianship that were significantly reduced. This created ideal conditions for burglars to target properties with minimal risk.

*   Shift in Criminal Opportunity:
Routine activity theory suggests that crime occurs when motivated offenders encounter suitable targets in the absence of capable guardians. As public spaces saw fewer interactions—leading to declines in crimes like larceny and assault—burglary became a more attractive option for offenders, particularly those targeting commercial premises or vacant homes.

*   Economic Pressures:
The financial uncertainty and increased economic stress during the pandemic may have driven some individuals toward property crimes as a means to supplement lost income. This economic desperation could partly explain the pronounced rise in burglaries, even as other crime categories experienced downturns.

*   Displacement Effects:
With heightened police presence and enforcement efforts in public areas to curb street crimes, offenders may have shifted their focus toward crimes that exploit less-monitored environments, such as burglary. This displacement of criminal activity underscores how changes in routine activities can have uneven impacts across different crime types.

Overall, the nearly 70% increase in burglaries during the COVID period signals that while reduced mobility and increased public enforcement helped lower other types of crimes, they inadvertently created vulnerabilities in areas with diminished guardianship. Studies such as those by Yim and Riddell (2022) have discussed similar trends during this period in san fransisco. For the last section, we will investigate the location trends for burglaries over time during this period. [[1]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9387408/)
